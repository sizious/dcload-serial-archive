# dcload-serial 1.0.6

**dcload** is a **Sega Dreamcast** (DC) serial loader written originally by 
[Andrew Kieschnick](http://napalm-x.thegypsy.com/andrewk/dc/), a.k.a.
**ADK/Napalm**. This program is part of 
[KallistiOS](http://gamedev.allusion.net/softprj/kos/) (KOS).

**dcload** is a set of programs made to send and receive data from your Sega
Dreamcast system. The classic use of this tool is to send programs to the
Dreamcast in order to run and debug them. To be used, you must have a way to
connect your Dreamcast console to your computer, it can be one of the following:

* A **Coders Cable** (a serial cable, the historical way to do that). It can be
  a cable with the classical `RS-232`/`DE-9` connector or with the 
  `FT232RL USB-Serial` module.
* A **Broadband Adapter**, ref. `HIT-400`, often shortened as **BBA**, a 
  `10/100Mbits` Ethernet network card.
* A **LAN Adapter**, ref. `HIT-300`, a `10Mbits` Ethernet network card.

If you have a Coders Cable, you have to use `dcload-serial`. For the Broadband
Adapter or LAN Adapter, you have to use `dcload-ip`.

**dcload** is split in two components:

* `dcload`, the server part, meant to be run on the Dreamcast;
* `dc-tool`, the client part, executed from your computer.

## Features

* Load `elf`, `srec` and `bin` (binary transfers are compressed).
* PC I/O (read, write from/to the PC).
* Exception handler.
* Debug Dreamcast programs remotely by using the **GDB-over-dcload** feature.

## Building

1. You should have a working 
   [KallistiOS](http://gamedev.allusion.net/softprj/kos/) (KOS) environment and
   of course the `sh-elf` toolchain installed (if you have installed KOS, you 
   already have everything ready).
2. Edit the `Makefile.cfg` file for your system and then run `make`.

## Installation

### dc-tool (client part)

Run `make install`: this will install `dc-tool` on your computer (default in
`/opt/toolchains/dc/bin`).

### dcload (server part)

For the Dreamcast part, you have two options.
   
* Directly burn to a disc by using `cdrecord`:

    a. Navigate to `make-cd`.
    b. Edit the `Makefile`.
    c. Insert blank CD-R.
    d. Run `make`. If the `1ST_READ.BIN` file hasn't been built yet, this 
       `Makefile` will build it.
 
* Create a **Padus DiscJuggler** (`CDI`) image to burn later (requires 
  the `mkisofs` and `cdi4dc` tools):

    a. `make -C ./host-src/misc` (build the miniLZO binary)
    b. `make -C ./target-src` (build the `1ST_READ.BIN`)
    c. `mkisofs -C 0,11702 -V dcload-serial -G ./make-cd/IP.BIN -joliet -rock -l -o temp.iso ./target-src/1st_read/1st_read.bin`
    d. `cdi4dc temp.iso dcload-serial.cdi`

## Testing

Everything is located in the `example-src` directory.

* `dc-tool-ser -x console-test`: tests some PC I/O
* `dc-tool-ser -x exception-test`: generates an exception

## KOS GDB-over-dcload

You have the possibility to use **dcload** to debug remotely Dreamcast binaries.
To run a GNU debugger session over the **dcload** connection:

1. Build/obtain an `sh-elf` targetted GNU debugger (can be made with `dc-chain`
   utility from [KallistiOS](http://gamedev.allusion.net/softprj/kos/)).
2. Put a `gdb_init()` call somewhere in the startup area of your
   KOS-based program (e.g. it's a good idea to put this call in your `main()`),
   then add the `#include <arch/gdb.h>` statement in that file.
3. Build your program with the `-g` GCC switch to include debugging info.
4. Launch your program using `dc-tool-ser -g -x <sh-executable>`.
5. Launch `sh-elf-gdb` and connect to the `dc-tool` using `target remote :2159`.
6. Squash bugs.

## Notes

* **dcload**, both IP and Serial, are maintained by the KOS
  team. Please join the [KallistiOS list](http://sf.net/projects/cadcdev/) 
  for help with these tools.
* Tested systems: Debian GNU/Linux 2.2; Gentoo/Linux 2.6.7; Cygwin;
  Mac OSX 10.3.5 (Panther); macOS 10.15.2 (Catalina), MinGW/MSYS, 
  [DreamSDK](https://www.dreamsdk.org), MinGW-w64/MSYS2.
* `1.56M` and `500K` baud now supported with the **FTDI USB-Serial** driver, 
  including the driver built into macOS 10.12 and above.
  **Note:** Works with the cheap and commonly available **FT232RL USB-Serial**
  boards as well as the (outdated) **FT232BM USB-Serial** chip running at
  `6.144Mhz`, e.g.:
    - Linux:   `dc-tool-ser -t /dev/usb/tts/0 -b 1500000 -x <sh-executable>`
    - Windows: `dc-tool-ser -t COM4 -b 500000 -x <sh-executable>`
    - macOS:   `dc-tool-ser -t /dev/cu.usbserial-A50285BI -b 1500000 -x <sh-executable>`
* As of `1.0.4`, little-endian byte order is enforced in the host so dc-tool
  now runs on big-endian systems like a Mac.
* As of `1.0.3`, serial speed is changed at runtime rather than compile time. 
* `115200` works fine in most cases but `57600` baud is the standard baud.
  There is an `-e` option that will enable an alternate `115200` which may work
  better in some rare cases. Use this only if the regular `115200` is unstable.
* Patches and improvements are welcome.

## Modern MacOS Notes

* This was tested on **Catalina 10.15.2** only, however it should work on pretty
  much any version of macOS. 
* Of course some sort of USB serial adapter must be used. The standard 
  **FT232RL USB-Serial** boards from China that are sold pretty much everywhere
  work great and are super cheap.
* Modern macOS supports the same speeds as the other platforms, currently 
  up to `1.56M` baud (`-b 1500000`). This was tested using Catalina and an 
  **FT232RL**.
* Compilation on macOS requires `libelf`, which can be easily installed using
  the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh): `brew install libelf`
* The static compilation option cannot be used on macOS due to the way GCC
  works on macOS. However, when building the standard dynamically linked build,
  only libSystem is linked (confirmed with `otool -L`) which is available on
  all macOS systems, so the binary should still be just as portable.
